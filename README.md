# TENPA DA YO !

This is my first project created from scratch !
« Tenpa da yo » comes from « Tennen paama » (天然パーマ), which means « natural curly hair » in Japanese. 

The original motivation for this app was helping people that are struggling with their curly hair and make their curly hair journey easier for them and hopefully, make them love their natural hair.

Going natural might be overwhelming and there is so much information about curly hair, which product to use etc.
This app summarizes tips and advices for beginners in their curly hair journey that summarize all the basic information they have to know (for example: what kind of products to use for different hair type, hair textures (fine, medium, coarse), what is their porosity (low, medium, high) and a curly hair routine suited to your hair characteristics.

It's a project using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Django.
